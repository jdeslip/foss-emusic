    <!-- About Text -->
    <string name="about_text">Update Nov. 21. eMusic.com update their website and broke downlaods in this app. Downloads have been disabled until I can reach out to eMusic and get a fix.\n\nThe FOSS eMusic application allows users to browse/search the eMusic.com collection and contains a download manager enabling current eMusic.com subcribers to download purchased albums/audiobooks/tracks directly to their Android phone.\n\nIf you are outside the US and often get the message that albums are not available in your region, please set your country code in the preferences.\n\nThis app is not in any way officially associated with eMusic.com. It is developed by one developer. If you like it, use it often, and want to show your appreciation, please consider buying the supporter version of the application!\n\nTo use FOSS eMusic, you should search or browse for an album/audiobook you want to download within the app. Press on the buy button on an album page to open a webview window for that album, sign in to your eMusic account (allow the webview to save your login credentials) and then press on a download link to download the album or track of interest using the included download manager. Note, you must be an eMusic.com subscriber with sufficient credits for any purchase you try to make. Downloaded tracks are automatically added to the Android music player library.\n\nTracks remain in the download manager until you clear them by pressing menu and selecting \"Clear Completed\". Note that downloads do expire after 24 hours - requiring you to start the download process again by repurchasing (unfortunately eMusic no longer allows you to redownload an album for free).\n\nWhat to do if your download fails?\n\nLong press on the track in the download manager list that has failed and select \"retry\" then press the download button at the top to restart the downloads. If you accidentally cleared the downloads, press the Menu button in the download manager and then press \".emx files\" to reload your purchased album. If that fails, return to the \"emx files\" menu and press and hold on the .emx file for your album, select \"send\" and email the file and the album name to jdeslipandroid@gmail.com.\n\nIf we cannot resolve your issue, you must contact eMusic customer service at http://www.emusic.com/contact/index.html to ask for your credits to be restored.</string>
